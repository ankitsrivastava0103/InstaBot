# InstaBot
Created a Web Scarping Insatgram Bot.  Which is used to extract information automatically. Used Python and Selinium (Web Scarping Automation Tools). In this project I 
have worked with the keyword <strong>"food bloggers"</strong> where I extract information related to top food bloggers, even like and unlike pictures present in there profile, 
store the hashtag's and few other feautres. Used Pythons's Matplotlib library to plot the relevants graph through which we can draw insightful sights (espically helpfull for food
bloggers). All this is done automatically because of use of Automation Tools. We can scarp milions of data withen few minitues.
